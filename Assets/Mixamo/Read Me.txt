-- Mixamo Shader Package --

Thanks for downloading the Mixamo Shader Package. Here's some info to help get you started using
these shaders effectively.

* All shaders use Diffuse, Specular, Gloss, and Normal maps.
* "Transparent" shaders have alpha enabled, and are single-pass unless otherwise noted.
* "MultiPass" shaders draw multiple times, and solve common sorting issues 
  (good for polystrip hair), at the expense of draw calls.
* Please note: We use the term "Specular" to mean the intensity of the specular highlight, 
  whereas "Gloss" controls the size of the specular highlight. This differs from Unity's interpretation
  of these terms, in that their definitions are reversed. If you have authored either of these maps for
  one environment, but plan to use them in the other, it may be helpful to be aware of this discrepancy.

1. Bump Spec Gloss
  * This shader is very similar to Unity's built-in "Bumped Specular" shader, with the addition of 
    a Gloss map, and a separate Specular map.

2. Cook Torrance
  * This shader is more algorithmically expensive than "Bump Spec Gloss," but has a more
    realistic lighting model.
  * This shader is most similar to Mixamo Fuse's internal lighting model.

3. Toon
  * Each channel (RGB) of the "Ramp Threshold" parameter controls the position of a corresponding "step." 
    The steps are responsible for creating the "Toon" effect, and light the model in discrete increments. 
  * Each channel of the "Ramp Values" parameter then controls the relative intensity of the 
    corresponding step.
  * The "Ramp Blend" parameter controls the softness of the step functions. At a value of 0, the 
    cutoff is very abrupt, with no interpolation between step values. At higher values, the transition 
    is more gradual, and approaches a standard diffuse gradient. Very small values
    work best for the toon effect, with the default being somewhere in the 0.08 range.
  * The "Outline Color" and "Outline Width" parameters control the appearance of the outline. 
    The outline can also be controlled via vertex color, if available. In this case, set the 
    Outline Color to white, as the vertex color and outline color are multiplied together. An outline
    width of 0 will remove the outline.

4. Mobile/Bump Spec Gloss
  * Optimized for Mobile Performance. Similar to Unity's builtin "Mobile/Bumped Specular" shader, 
    but with Gloss and a separate Specular map.

5. Transparent/Bump Spec Gloss

6. Transparent/Bump Spec Gloss Multipass

7. Transparent/Cook Torrance

8. Transparent/Cook Torrance Multipass

9. Transparent/Hair Multipass
  * The "Groove" Parameter controls the spread of an anisotropic specular highlight. It is otherwise 
    very similar to the Bump Spec Gloss Multipass shader.

10. Transparent/Toon

11. Transparent/Toon Multipass
